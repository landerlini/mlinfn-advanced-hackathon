    "# Physics Informed Neural Network\n",
    "Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models that incorporate physical laws, typically expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs), into the training process. By embedding these equations into the loss function, PINNs enable neural networks to learn solutions that are consistent with known physics, even when data is scarce or noisy. This approach is particularly useful for solving forward and inverse problems in science, where traditional numerical methods may be computationally expensive or limited by incomplete information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve a PDE you need (i) a domain (D) definition, (ii) an initial (or constrined) condition (IC), and (iii) boundary condition (BC). These requirements define a boundary value problem (BVP).\n",
    "Since the aim in a PINN experiment is to find an approximate solution to a BVP, the inputs to these networks are spatiotemporal coordinates and the outputs are the solution values at those points and times.\\\n",
    "During training, we can distinguish a supervised component — the data-driven part (e.g., experimental data embedded in the IC) — and an unsupervised component — the equation-driven part provided by the PDE and the BC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we implement a PINN for a simple BVP that admits an analytic solution. This will provide the fundamental tools used subsequently for more complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** No specific Python library is suggested. Students should write the code using whichever libraries they prefer."

    "   - Output layer: dimension = 1 (representing `u(x, t)`)\n",
    "   - Must satisfy the universal approximation theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activation function:**\n",
    "   - Must be continuously differentiable (the network needs to compute derivatives)\n",
    "   - Common choices: `tanh`, `sigmoid`, `softplus`, `GELU`\n",
    "   - Avoid: `ReLU` (non-differentiable at 0, though often works in practice)\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Output: Array of shape `(N, 1)` containing predicted `u(x, t)` values\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model capacity:** Start simple, then increase complexity if needed\n",
    "   - For this 1D heat equation, try starting with 2-3 hidden layers of 20-50 neurons each\n",
    "   - If the model doesn't learn well, consider increasing depth or width\n",

    "2. **Parameter initialization:** This is critical for PINN training!\n",
    "   - **Problem:** Random normal initialization often leads to trivial solutions (e.g., `u ≈ 0` everywhere)\n",

    "     - Use **Glorot/Xavier uniform initialization** (strongly recommended)\n",

    "**Task 7.1:** Implement the training procedure\n",

    "Now that all components are ready, implement the optimization loop to train your PINN.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Core Training Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Your training loop should perform these steps at each iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample points:** Generate new random sets of:\n",
    "   - Interior points `(x, t)` using `sample_interior(N1)`\n",
    "   - Boundary points `(x, t)` using `sample_boundary(N2)`\n",
    "   - Initial condition points `(x, 0)` using `sample_initial(N3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forward pass & loss computation:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the network at all sampled points\n",
    "   - Compute `L_PDE`, `L_BC`, `L_IC`, and `L_total`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backward pass & optimization:**\n",
    "   - Compute gradients of `L_total` with respect to network parameters\n",
    "   - Update parameters using an optimizer (Adam recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Monitoring:**\n",
    "   - Print/log loss values periodically\n",
    "   - Track the best model (lowest total loss)\n",
    "   - Save checkpoints when a new minimum is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Implementation Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "For clean, readable code, consider organizing as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option A: Unified PDE function**\n",
    "- Create a function `compute_pde_loss(model, interior_points, boundary_points, initial_points, D, L)` that:\n",
    "  - Takes all inputs and hyperparameters\n",
    "  - Returns all loss components `(L_total, L_PDE, L_BC, L_IC)`\n",
    "- Your training loop then only needs:\n",
    "  1. Sample points from `Geometry` class\n",
    "  2. Call `compute_pde_loss()` within gradient computation context\n",
    "  3. Apply optimizer step\n",
    "  4. Monitor and save\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option B: Separate components**\n",
    "- Keep loss functions separate as implemented in Task 5\n",
    "- Call them individually in the training loop\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Training Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimizer:**\n",
    "- **Recommended:** Adam with learning rate `1e-3` to `1e-4`\n",
    "- **Alternative:** Try L-BFGS for fine-tuning after initial Adam training (see tips below)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of epochs:**\n",
    "- Start with 5,000-10,000 epochs\n",
    "- Monitor loss curves to determine if more training is needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling sizes:**\n",
    "- Typical values: `N1=1000`, `N2=200`, `N3=200`\n",
    "- Adjust based on computational resources and convergence behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.4 Tips & Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Loss weighting (if needed):**\n",
    "   - If one loss component dominates, consider weighting: `L_total = w1·L_PDE + w2·L_BC + w3·L_IC`\n",
    "   - Start with equal weights (1, 1, 1) and adjust if necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Advanced optimization - L-BFGS:**\n",
    "   - Some PINN literature recommends [L-BFGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm) (second-order optimizer)\n",
    "   - **Strategy:** Train with Adam first, then fine-tune with L-BFGS\n",
    "   - Not required but can improve convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Monitoring:**\n",
    "   - Print each loss component separately to diagnose issues\n",
    "   - If one component doesn't decrease, check its implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Stopping criterion:**\n",
    "   - **Key question:** *Without a validation set, how do you decide when to stop training?*\n",
    "   - Consider:\n",
    "     - Has the total loss plateaued?\n",
    "     - Are all three loss components sufficiently small?\n",
    "     - Does the solution look physically reasonable?\n",
    "     - Compare with analytical solution (if available, as in this exercise)\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Checkpointing:**\n",
    "   - Save the model parameters whenever `L_total` reaches a new minimum\n",
    "   - This protects against divergence in later epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.5 Expected Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, you should observe:\n",
    "- All loss components decreasing over time\n",
    "- `L_IC` typically decreases fastest (it's supervised)\n",
    "- `L_PDE` often decreases more slowly\n",
    "- Total loss should eventually plateau at a low value (e.g., < 0.01 or lower)"

    "### 9.1 Diffusion in Fricke Gel – 1D Inverse Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest diffusion experiment involving Fricke hydrogel consists of a small rod that is half-irradiated, as shown in the figure below. In this case, a chelating agent—which induces color changes in accordance with the amount of ferric ions—was added to the gel. It follows that dose estimation can be performed through optical measurements of absorbance.  \n",
    "In other words, absorbance (what you measure) is proportional to the amount of ferric ions, which in turn is proportional to the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![1d_fricke_gel](./images/fricke_gel_irr.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After irradiation, ferric ions diffuse within the gel matrix, causing the loss of the initial shape, as shown in the animation below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![1d_evolution](./images/1D_evolution.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ions cannot move outside the gel, the concentration flux at the boundaries is zero. This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}A(x,t) = 0 \\quad \\text{with} \\quad x = \\{0, L\\}\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "(*Von Neumann boundary condition*)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A(x,t)$ is the measured absorbance at position $x$ and time $t$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The main physical consequence is that the total amount of ferric ions does not change, and consequently, the total absorbed dose remains constant as well.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 9.1:** Recover the initial distribution from a later measurement (inverse problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "This advanced exercise explores one of PINNs' most powerful capabilities: solving inverse problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.2 Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In [experimental_data folder](./experimental_data/) 4 sets at $t = \\{1,4,7,10\\}\\ h$ of Absorbance as a function of position are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First experimental distribution:** `A(x, t)` at time `t = 1.0 h` (Initial distribution cannot be measured)\n",
    "- **Diffused distribution:** `A(x, t)` at later times `t = t_measurement = [4.0, 7.0, 10.0] h`\n",
    "- **Diffusion coefficient:** it was experimentally determined as `D = 0.249 mm²/h`\n",
    "- **Boundary conditions:** `∂A/∂x(0, t) = ∂A/∂x(L, t) = 0` for all `t > 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your goal:** Starting from the measurement at `t = t_measurement`, reconstruct the initial distribution at `t = 1.0 h` (predicting `t = 0.0 h` is possible but ground truth is not provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an **inverse problem** (going backward in time) and is generally ill-posed for the heat equation due to its irreversible nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.3 Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modifications to your PINN:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Change the supervised data:**\n",
    "   - Instead of using the initial condition `A(x, 0) = sin(πx/L)` as training data...\n",
    "   - Use the measurement at `t = t_measurement` as your supervised constraint\n",
    "   - New loss: `L_data = mean((NN(x, t_measurement) - u_measured(x, t_measurement))²)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predict backward:**\n",
    "   - Train the network to satisfy the PDE throughout `t ∈ [0, t_measurement]`\n",
    "   - The network should learn to \"reverse\" the diffusion process\n",
    "   - After training, evaluate `NN(x, 1.0)` to get the reconstructed initial condition\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handle discrete measurements:**\n",
    "   - **Challenge:** You only have discrete measurement points, not a continuous function\n",
    "   - **Solution:** Use interpolation to evaluate `u_measured` at arbitrary points\n",
    "   - Suggested: [Scipy interpolation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html) (e.g., `scipy.interpolate.interp1d` or `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline`)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.4 Modified Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Your new total loss should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}_{total} = \\mathcal{L}_{PDE} + \\mathcal{L}_{BC} + \\mathcal{L}_{data}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `L_PDE`: Same as before (enforces heat equation throughout the domain)\n",
    "- `L_BC`: Must be modified for Neumann BCs: `∂u/∂x(0, t) = ∂u/∂x(L, t) = 0`\n",
    "- `L_data`: New supervised loss using measurements at `t = t_measurement`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You're replacing `L_IC` (initial condition supervision) with `L_data` (measurement supervision).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.5 Key Questions to Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 9.1:** *How far back in time can you reliably reconstruct?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with different values of `t_measurement`:\n",
    "- Start with small values (e.g., `t_measurement = 4.0 h`)\n",
    "- Gradually increase to larger values (e.g., `7.0 h`, `10.0 h`)\n",
    "- Additional measurements at longer times can be generated using the FTCS scheme\n",
    "- At what point does reconstruction fail or become very inaccurate?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factors to investigate:**\n",
    "1. **Reconstruction error vs. time:**\n",
    "   - Plot reconstruction error as a function of `t_measurement`\n",
    "   - Observe when error grows unacceptably large\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Role of noise:** (can be skipped with real experimental data)\n",
    "   - Add Gaussian noise to the measurement data: `A_noisy = A_measured + ε·N(0,1)`\n",
    "   - How does noise affect reconstruction quality?\n",
    "   - Try different noise levels\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regularization:**\n",
    "   - Can you improve reconstruction by adding regularization terms to the loss?\n",
    "   - Example: Penalize roughness of the initial condition\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Physical intuition:**\n",
    "   - Why does the heat equation make backward reconstruction difficult?\n",
    "   - Think about information loss during diffusion\n",
    "   - How does this relate to the second law of thermodynamics?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.6 Expected Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training instability:**\n",
    "   - Inverse problems are typically more difficult to train\n",
    "   - You may need: smaller learning rates, more iterations, better initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-uniqueness:**\n",
    "   - Multiple initial conditions might produce similar measurements\n",
    "   - The PINN might converge to different solutions with different random seeds\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sensitivity to hyperparameters:**\n",
    "   - Loss weighting becomes more critical\n",
    "   - Network architecture may need adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips:**\n",
    "- Start with small `t_measurement` where the problem is easier\n",
    "- Use multiple random seeds and compare results\n",
    "- Visualize intermediate solutions during training to debug issues\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.7 Extension Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "If you complete the basic inverse problem, consider:\n",
    "1. **Unknown diffusion coefficient:** Simultaneously learn `D` and initial condition\n",
    "2. **Sparse measurements:** Use only a few spatial points at `t_measurement`\n",
    "3. **Multiple time measurements:** Use data at several different times"

    "## 10.8 Key Observations and Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Solved a realistic 2D inverse problem** - Reconstructed initial dose distribution from diffused measurements\n",
    "2. **Used existing simulation tools** - Leveraged FTCS module for ground truth data generation\n",
    "3. **Implemented JAX-based PINN** - Custom architecture consistent with the notebook's approach\n",
    "4. **Enforced physical constraints** - PDE and Neumann boundary conditions built into the loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 Physical Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diffusion blurs information**: The longer the time between irradiation and measurement, the harder reconstruction becomes\n",
    "- **Inverse problems are ill-posed**: Small changes in measurements can lead to large changes in reconstructed initial conditions\n",
    "- **Boundary conditions matter**: Neumann (no-flux) BCs are physically appropriate for sealed gel containers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Suggested Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time sensitivity analysis**: \n",
    "   - Try different `t_measure_2d` values (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)\n",
    "   - Plot reconstruction error vs. measurement time\n",
    "   - Find the \"practical limit\" for reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Noise robustness**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Add noise to measurements\n",
    "   noise_level = 0.05\n",
    "   final_2d_noisy = final_2d + noise_level * np.random.randn(*final_2d.shape)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - How does measurement noise affect reconstruction quality?\n",
    "   - Can regularization improve robustness?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unknown diffusion coefficient**:\n",
    "   - Make `D` a learnable parameter\n",
    "   - Simultaneously learn both initial condition and `D`\n",
    "   - This is a \"double inverse\" problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sparse measurements**:\n",
    "   - Instead of full 2D measurement, use only scattered point measurements\n",
    "   - More realistic for actual experimental setups\n",
    "   - Tests PINN's interpolation capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Different initial geometries**:\n",
    "   - Try circle, multiple spots, or arbitrary shapes\n",
    "   - Test on clinically relevant dose distributions\n",
    "   - Vary smoothness and complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Comparison with other methods**:\n",
    "   - Backward FTCS (unstable but instructive)\n",
    "   - Tikhonov regularization\n",
    "   - Traditional deconvolution techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Tips for Better Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss weighting**: Experiment with `w_pde`, `w_bc`, `w_data` ratios\n",
    "- **Network capacity**: Increase layers/neurons for complex distributions\n",
    "- **Training duration**: 2D problems may need 10,000+ epochs\n",
    "- **Learning rate schedule**: Consider decay strategies\n",
    "- **Multiple initializations**: Run with different random seeds and ensemble results\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎓 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This advanced exercise demonstrates PINNs' power for solving **realistic inverse problems** in medical physics. By combining:\n",
    "- Physical laws (diffusion equation)\n",
    "- Boundary constraints (Neumann conditions)  \n",
    "- Sparse/indirect measurements (diffused dose)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can recover information that would be impossible with data-driven methods alone. This approach is directly applicable to:\n",
    "- **Radiation therapy dosimetry** (Fricke gels)\n",
    "- **Drug delivery** (diffusion in tissues)\n",
    "- **Environmental monitoring** (pollutant dispersion)\n",
    "- **Materials science** (thermal/mass transport)\n",
