    "# Diffusion in Dose Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Dose distribution can be measured in several ways using different dosimetric techniques. One promising technique exploits the use of chemical dosimeters, also known as Fricke gels. A Fricke gel is made from a solution of iron sulfate embedded in a gel matrix. When ionizing radiation interacts with a Fricke gel, ferrous ions ($Fe^{2+}$) are oxidized into ferric ions ($Fe^{3+}$). Exploiting its paramagnetic properties, $Fe^{3+}$ can be mapped using MRI or optical scans, where the measured signals are proportional to the absorbed dose.\\\n",
    "Although their motion is strongly hindered by the gel matrix, $Fe^{3+}$ diffusion cannot be completely suppressed. This results in blurring of the measured distributions, with an amplitude that depends on the time interval between irradiation and measurement. Since MRI or optical scanners are not usually freely available immediately after irradiation, ion diffusion limits the clinical use of Fricke gels.\n",

    "\n",
    "Physics-Informed Neural Networks can be trained to recover the initial dose distribution, given the diffused distribution and the diffusion coefficient.\n",
    "To apply this technique, we first need an experimental setup. Let’s start by defining an initial distribution."

    "\n",
    "The [FTCS module](./FTCS) is a Python implementation of the Forward in Time, Central in Space (FTCS) scheme for the numerical solution of the diffusion equation in 2D. The `Diffusion2D` class, defined in the [FTCS_scheme file](./FTCS/FTCS_scheme.py), allows the user to set the entire geometry. Additionally, it can be initialized with a stable time step (i.e., a time interval that satisfies the stability condition of the scheme). The module provides many functions, which the reader is encouraged to explore."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "This simple notebook reproduces the most basic physical processes that occur in a Fricke gel after irradiation. In reality, diffusion in Fricke gels can be much more complex. For instance, adding a chelating agent—used to enable dose measurements through absorbance—induces an auto-oxidation process.\n",

    "The [FTCS module](./FTCS/FTCS_scheme.ipynb) also includes diffusion with a source term. Try using it!\n",
